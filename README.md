## Prerequisites

For the code to work, you will need:

- [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
- install Selenium: `pip install selenium` or `pip3 install selenium`
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) installed, try to have the latest version
- and the [driver for Chrome](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/downloads)

Make sure to match the browser and driver versions, Chrome 96, as of this writing.
